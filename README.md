# Non-Equilibrium_P1
Codes for Non-Equilibrium P1: Brownian Dynamics, Fluctuations and Response. 

Multiple files:

- Main.py: just the main for the Project 1. Each flag, relates to one of the coding exercises.
- random_generator.py : generates a N(0,1) from a uniform and plots it.
- movement.py: generates the movement of 1 particle with or without Periodic Boundary Conditions
- configuration.py: saves the trajectories for N particles
- diffusivity.py: computes MSD (Mean-squared displacement) and D (Diffusivity)
- plots.py: plots multiple things: trajectories, configurations, msd vs time, D vs Gamma.

Results are found in the practice report.
